If you want some truely custom gametypes but can't be bothered with fancy hacking tools, this is the thing for you. Just get yourself a hex editor (I recommend HxD on Windows, or Okteta on Linux) and you're ready to go. This should allow custom score limits for every gametype, custom time limits, custom weapon spawns including no weapons and two of the same weapon, custom respawn times including INSTANT RESPAWNS!!, and other specific things like fast movement speed with the flag, and even FFA Territories*!

Funnily enough, you *can* turn Team Play off for Territories! Even though this is normally a teams only gametype, you can change the bit to turn it off and play it FFA style, and its fully working! Capturing a territory and seeing the flag turn your spartans color with your emblem is pretty awesome. I was only ever able to test up to 5 players, but from what I can gather, changing team play off makes it look like an FFA gametype all save for the territores display in the HUD, which still shows teams. From the top of the lobby first player gets red, secone blue, third green, fourth yellow, etc. IDK what happens when you get to 9 players or more though, since I couldn't test it. Good luck to anyone willing to try it!

Just be aware that its possible to make the CTF flag have no reset timer (only returns by touch return) and have touch return off, making the flag impossible to return, which could mean the flag is going to eventually get scored (looking at you CTFCoag), but will make the match possibly unendable if it ends up out of bounds. Even deadlier if you turn "Flag at Home to Score" on, 'cause if both you and the enemy team ever get each others flags at the same time, the match will become literally unwinnable for both of you. You have been warned.


NOTES: All save games, gametypes included, are stored in little endian format (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness), as that is the endianness of the Xbox's CPU. If a variable noted below is saved with 2 bytes of data, its stored in 2's compliment form (so all values 8000-FFFF will "corrupt" the gametype since they read in as a negative number). This only applies to variables saved in 2 bytes. If it's saved in 1 bytes, its only 0-255 (unsigned).

Gametype names can only be 16 characters long max, and the name in both slayer (or ctf, koth, etc) should exactly math the name found in savemeta.bin, otherwise the game likes to flips out after the first time you edit it/play it.

If you want to convert an gametype pulled from an OG Xbox to play on H2V, or just want to better understand how H2 gametypes are saved, check out this thread: https://www.halo2.online/threads/convert-halo-2-xbox-gametypes-to-halo-2-vista-gametypes.2801/

I didn't go through all the trouble of seeing what every possible character combination is possible for characters, but they are stored as 16 bit (2 byte) wide characters (remember, little endian!) so making simple names like "SWAT 69 lives" is simple enough. 

As far as I know, SaveImage.xbx is not required to be present for any save data, profiles or gametypes, to work, but I have not confirmed this. If it does tho, I know it doesn't use it, so a dummy file will do the trick if you're trying to generate an entire gametype externally rather than create one made by the game itself.

I originally wrote this document more for myself than anything while documenting all the gametype options and values, and hastily released it with no proof reading at all when I left the Cartographer community in early 2019, so that version was very messy. This copy is basically the same file, but I combed through the document again to be sure that everything was present and correct, as some things were copy and pasted previously and never got edited with correct values, was just straight up wrong (lol Xbox isn't big endian), or was completely missing like the "Extra Damage" and "Damage Resistence" boolean flags. All the bytes are written like they are for easier reading and finding the byte in a hex editor (well its easier to me at least), but adding them gets the actual byte number if you need it.

Anytime you see [?] next to a gametype, then the option is valid but the description for it is just what I have observed about that option. You can do further testing of these options if you'd like but the descriptions are accurate enough and the results are generally uninteresting IMO.

    - Funnily enough, this option *can* be turned off! Even though this is normally a teams only gametype, you can change the bit to turn it off and play it FFA style, and it works too! Capturing a territory and seeing the flag turn your spartans color with your emblem is pretty awesome. I was only ever able to test up to 5 players, but from what I can gather, chaning team play off makes it look like an FFA gametype all save for the territores display in the HUD, which still shows teams. The top player in the lobby gets red, secone blue, third green, fourth yellow, etc. IDK what happens when you get to 9 players or more though, since I couldn't test it. Good luck to anyone willing to try it!
