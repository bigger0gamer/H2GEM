Description
===========

Welcome to H2GEM~!! This program allows you to manage and edit all of your Halo 2 gametypes.

- Convert signed Halo 2 Xbox (H2X) gametype saves into unencrypted Halo 2 Vista (H2V) saves and back, individually or all at once!
- Edit existing H2X and H2V gametypes, including rich gametype options not normally available for selection when editing gametypes in game!
  - Custom score and time limits, up to a score of 32,767 and a time limit of 9 hours, 6 minutes, and 7 seconds
  - Custom respawn times as quick as instant (~1 second), or as long as 4 minutes, 15 seconds
  - Custom life limits up to 255
  - Spawn with any weapon, including two of the same weapon, or no weapon at all!
  - Custom Object reset times, including never resetting! (Careful not to make impossible CTF gametypes!)
  - Fast movement with held objectives in all gametypes, Ex. Fast movement with flag in CTF
  - A never before seen Sentinel Beams on map weapon set!
  - And most amazing of all: Free for All Territories! (I've only been able to personally test up to 5 players)
  - And probably more I didn't think to put in this description!
- Generate a list.txt file that lists all of your gametypes by name and gamemode, and the folder they are contained in for H2X and H2V gametypes. Find and share/copy your favorite gametypes easily!


Usage
=====

This program requires the Java Runtime Environment to run. To run, simply use `java H2GEM` in the H2GEM directory. Windows users can just double click on `run.bat` instead (you may not see the file extension). A command prompt window will appear with the program in it. This program runs entirely in the command line, as I was too lazy to bother with a GUI. To select options, just enter the number or letter corresponding to the desired option into the terminal, and hit enter. 

For H2X gametypes, just FTP the contents of `/E/UDATA/4d53006` to `Halo 2 Gametype Editor & Manager/4d530064`, and then FTP it back when you are done.

For H2V gametypes, on Windows H2GEM will edit and convert your gametypes directly from your current users appdata. Linux users will either have to specify their Saved Games path when it launches, or use the `-ap` or `-wp` command line options to specify the absolute path to Saved Games, or the wine prefix path respectively when they launch the program. 


Copyrights & Respects
=====================

This program has been released with no copyright license because honestly I can't be bothered to fuck with copyright shit. Source code is included, along with a text file that documents all the variables in Halo 2 gametypes and all the possible options for them, so feel free to modify or use this code as you please, but be sure to credit me if you use it or the reference document for any of your projects!

I'd like to make a special thanks to M0niak and Divine1gore for being cool people, even if I haven't talked to either of you in ages.

Have a great day~!
