Quick Notes:

 - To edit or manage H2X saves, FTP the contents of /E/UDATA/4d530064 from your xbox, and put them in the 4d530064 folder next to this readme file.
 - H2V gametypes are loaded from their default save location if you're running Windows, so no need to move/copy them anywhere to edit or manage them. If you aren't running Windows, then H2GEM will attempt to load them from the Saved Games folder next to this readme by default.
 - You can use the arguments "-ap" and "-wp" to send the absolute path of your "Saved Games" folder for H2V, and your wine prefix for H2V respectively.

Welcome to H2GEM~!! This program allows you to manage and edit all of your Halo 2 gametypes.

 - Convert signed Halo 2 Xbox (H2X) gametype saves into unencrypted Halo 2 Vista (H2V) saves and back, individually or all at once!
 - Edit existing H2X and H2V gametypes, including rich gametype options not normally available for selection when editing gametypes in game!
   - Custom score and time limits, up to a score of 32,767 and a time limit of 9 hours, 6 minutes, and 7 seconds
   - Custom respawn times as quick as instant (~1 second), or as long as 4 minutes, 15 seconds
   - Custom life limits up to 255
   - Spawn with any weapon, including two of the same weapon, or no weapon at all!
   - Custom Object reset times, including never resetting! (Careful not to make impossible CTF gametypes!)
   - Fast movement with held objectives in all gametypes, Ex. Fast movement with flag in CTF
   - A never before seen Sentinel Beams on map weapon set!
   - And most amazing of all: Free for All Territories! (I've only been able to personally test up to 5 players)
   - And probably more I didn't think to put in this description!
 - Generate a list.txt file that lists all of your gametypes by name and gamemode, and the folder they are contained in for H2X and H2V gametypes. Find and share/copy your favorite gametypes easily!

This program was created by ~ ♀ Yuri Bacon ♀ ~. This program has been released with no copyright license because honestly I can't be bothered to fuck with copyright shit. Source code is included, along with a text file that documents all the variables in Halo 2 gametypes and all the possible options for them, so feel free to modify or use this code as you please, but be sure to credit me if you use it or the reference document for any of your projects! 

I'd like to make a special thanks to M0niak and Divine1gore for being cool people, even if I haven't talked to either of you in ages.
